                    <li className={styles.list}>1)Enhanced real estate photography and videography</li>

                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>Using drones to capture unique stills or videos of real estate properties is perhaps one of the most talked about uses for drones from a commercial prospective…

                        If you’re a real estate agent looking for an outstanding way to showcase your properties, using a drone to capture aerial stills and video of the homes you are listing can be a great way to catch potential buyers’ attention.

                        Aerial stills and footage of the properties you are listing will give home shoppers a good idea of the property’s surrounding areas and will give them a complete look at the entirety of the property.

                        And, ultimately, by offering a better all-around listing, you will likely win the hearts of more potential clients.</p>

                    </div>

                    <li className={styles.list}>2)Turn yourself into a tech-savvy farmer</li>


                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>Are you a farmer? Do you also love technology? Would you like to use your love of technology to help you be a more efficient farmer?

                        If so, then you may want to consider getting a drone to help you monitor your farm and help you get important data about your crops.

                        There are many drone companies and projects being launched that will aim to improve the way farms operate. Such projects and companies will seek to determine things like the health of crops, whether or not crops are getting enough water, how much pesticide to apply and where to apply it, and the best times for harvesting.

                        Drones can also be used by farmers to save time scouting their crops, getting a better idea for crop rotation, and mapping out their farm.

                        In the future, drones will open up wide possibilities for farmers and their ability to maximize the yield from their crops.</p>

                    <li className={styles.list}>3)Give your photography business an edge</li>


                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>Do you run a photography business? If so, adding a drone to your camera-arsenal can give you an edge over your competitors when potential clients in your area are looking for a photographer.

                        With a drone you can capture photos and videos from angles that other photographers (ones who do not have drones) simply will never be able to reach.

                        Drones are quickly becoming popular for weddings, events, and family photo sessions simply because of the unique perspective they can add to such photo or video sessions.

                        Ultimately, by offering drone photography and videography you are offering your clients a more complete package.</p>

                    <li className={styles.list}>4)Get into a technology that has a big future</li>

                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>Some people will want to get a drone simply because it is the hot new technology. It’s like owning computer in the late 80’s early 90’s, except that consumer drones now are much more useful than consumer computers were during that time period.

                        But, just as there was a”cool” factor associated with owning computer then (being an early-adopter is always cool), the same is true for owning a drone now. And, while it is true that there were a ton of drones sold in 2017, the market for consumer drones projects to hit well over $1 billion by the end of 2019…

                        So… it’s safe to say that the market for consumer drones is still in its infancy. And, if you want to be one of the early-adopters of the technology, now is the time to hop on board.</p>



                    <div className={styles.imgcontainer2}>

                        <img className={styles.img} src="/fun.jpg" alt="" />

                    </div>


                    <li className={styles.list}>5)For fun</li>



                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>Perhaps the best reason to get a drone is, simply, because they are a lot of fun. Even with the FAA rolling out new consumer-oriented regulations that limit what you can do with a drone, drones are still a lot of fun to fly.

                        I’m not really sure what it is, but man has always had a fascination with attempting to conquer things he shouldn’t really be able to… and with drones, that attempt is for man to further it’s domain over the skies.

                        In any case, flying a drone can be a very enjoyable experience… especially if you have a capable drone that is easy to fly. If you haven’t flown a drone, yet, I recommend you do so.</p>


                    <div className={styles.imgcontainer2}>

                        <img className={styles.img} src="/footage.jpg" alt="" />

                    </div>

                    <li className={styles.list}>6)Capture stunning footage</li>


                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>Obviously the biggest thrill for drone enthusiasts is the fact that they can take stunning aerial photos and videos and they don’t have to be expert photographers to get those shots.

                        This is simply because any aerial shot (assuming it’s taken by a quality camera) has a certain quality of awe to it and so you don’t have to be a professional to get a really cool photo or video.

                        So, essentially, if you want to capture video or footage that nobody else can get to, you need a drone.</p>

                    </div>



                    <li className={styles.list}>7)Stand out on social media</li>


                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>We all follow people who post daily selfies on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. And, we all wonder why they get so many followers…

                        Now, I’m not suggesting you should be a one-upper, but… you should definitely one-up them and take daily selfies as well… with your drone. That is, of course, if you want to become the new king or queen of your social media circle.

                        Seriously, though, one of the best ways to build a big social media following is to post high-quality videos or photos that are unique. And, what better way to do that than with a drone?</p>

                        <img className={styles.img} src="/vr.jpg" alt="" />

                    </div>

                    <li className={styles.list}>8)Fly through the air… from the ground!</li>

                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>One of the coolest features of some of the more high-end drones on the market is the ability to live stream your flight footage right to your mobile device. This is called FPV (First Person View).

                        Many drones now are controlled partially through a mobile app on your phone or tablet. For instance, the DJI Phantom 3 series comes with their transmitter, which has the standard control features, and then you also need to connect your smartphone or tablet to the transmitter and use their app for the rest of the flying features they offer.

                        And, with their app, your phone/tablet will actually display exactly what the camera on your drone is seeing. So, instead of having to look up at your drone in the skies at all times, you can look at your tablet and get a first-person view of what your drone’s camera is looking at.

                        There are many benefits of FPV in terms of positioning your drone for the best shot possible, but one of the coolest aspects of this is that it allows you to see what it would be like to fly through the air. There are even FPV-dedicated goggles that you can wear to isolate the view (though it’s a good idea to have a spotter with a direct line-of-sight on the drone).</p>

                        <img className={styles.img} src="/drone2.jpg" alt="" />

                    </div>

                    <li className={styles.list}>9)They’re becoming more affordable</li>

                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>Consumer drones now range from as low as ~$40 to as expensive as ~$3,000 or more. But the less expensive drones are continually becoming better and easier to fly.

                        Even sub $50 drones like the Syma X5C come equipped with a camera and some advanced features like return-to-home. That’s pretty amazing for a ~$50 quadcopter.

                        And, while the Syma X5C doesn’t have the most amazing camera setup (shoots in 720p and doesn’t have a gimbal to stabilize video), it shows you that affordable drones are both capable and improving.</p>

                    <div className={styles.imgcontainer2}>

                        <img className={styles.img} src="/simple.jpg" alt="" />

                    </div>
                    <li className={styles.list}>10)They’re actually not that hard to fly…</li>

                    <p className={styles.paragraph}>Now this is probably subjective as there are a lot of drone-enthusiasts out there who would argue that flying a drone is a difficult endeavor takes a lot of practice.

                        And, I won’t argue with those people because they have a lot of YouTube videos to backup that claim.

                        However, in my experience, drones are becoming easier and easier to fly and some of the high-end drones on the market (like the DJI Phantom 3 series and the 3DR Solo) are so simple to fly that it’s kind of amazing…

                        That’s not to say that problems don’t arise during flights, or that the Phantom 3 and the Solo are perfect, but rather that if you use common sense and fly your drone with caution when you are first starting out, you will be surprised to see how well they handle and how easy they are to navigate.</p>
